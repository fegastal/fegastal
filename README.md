I'm an architect, urbanist and programmer! ✨
I'm also a student at 42 São Paulo and at Lisbon Higher Institute of Advanced Technologies and I'm currently focused on Python, Java and MySQL.

- 💻 I'm  studying Software Engineering at [École 42](https://www.42.fr/) - [São Paulo unit](https://www.42sp.org.br/) and Mobile Development at [ISTEC](http://www.istec.pt/index.php/ctesp-desenvolvimento-para-dispositivos-moveis/)
- ⚙️ I use daily:  `.c` | `.py` | `.java`
- 🌻 I'm currently learning about C for the projects done at School 42, however I study Python, Java and MySQL for the development of personal projects!
- 🌞 Fun fact: I'm programming since 2019, but I have a degree in architecture and urbanism from University of São Paulo (USP - Brazil) and University of Lisbon (ULisboa - Portugal)
